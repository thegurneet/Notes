~~~~~~~~~~~
    GOAL
~~~~~~~~~~~
      The Goal of the WEPT project is to replace the current WebMethods integration platform and migrate Circa 170 messages on to the future state solution.

      Currently HMRC uses :  "webMethods Itegration Software". Primarily utilising a publish/subscribe design pattern.
                    webMethods is an enterpise software company- focused on application integration, business process integration and B2B partner integration.

          The current version of webMethods used by HMRC is no longer supported by Software AG.

    Broker
************

A message broker (sometimes known as an Integration broker / interface engine) is an intermediary computer program module that translates a message from the formal
messaging protocol of the send of the formal messaging protocol of the receiver. Message brokers are elements in computer networks where software applications communicate by exchanging
formally-defined messages.

a message broker is an architectural pattern for message validation, transformation and routing. The purpose of a broker is to take incoming messages from applications and perform some actions on them.
For example a message broker may be used to manage a workload queue or message queue for multiple receivers, providing reliable storage, guaranteed message delivery and perhaps transaction management.

Some examples of actions that might be handled by a broker:

  - Route messages to one or more destinations
  - transform messages to an alternative representation
  - Perform message aggregation , decomposing messages into multiple messages and sending them to their destination - then recompsing the responses into one message to return to the user.
  - Invoke web services to retrieve  data.
  - Response to events or errors.
