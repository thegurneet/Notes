1 - Patterns in WEPT

            We are using 4 messauure patterns:
                - P-IF to S-IF          : IF is the Intergration framework  P is the publisher , S is the Subsriber.

2. Message Cardinalities


            -   1:1

            -   1:N             : 1 Subsriber and many publishers

            -   N:1             : many subsribers and 1 publishers

3. Multiroute MICROSERVICES
      Has to be configured at the root level.

    1. Allow to host multiple camel routes ins ingle microservice.
    2. All related routes per Head of Duty (HoD) System
    3. Single Container.


4. Scheduler

    Two scheduler used in the Webmethod and IF platform. The Scheduler is hosted with the multiroute microservice. So each service will have their own scheduler.

      Serial.  - single threaded.

      Concurrent.  - Scheduler will be scheduling multiple threads. Multiple threads will be scheduler at the same time.


5. Filtering

    For filtering a message, where there is a multiple subsribers or publisher.



6. Generic Publisher and Subsriber.
