"Invention requires two things: 1 - the ability to try alot of experiments and
 2 - not having to live with the collateral damage of failed experiments"


-----------------------------
  AWS Global Infrastructure
-----------------------------
  Regions around the world where AWS is based.

  On top of the global Infrastructure sits alot of higher level services.

  Compute  :   examples - EC2, Lambda etc.
  Storage  :            - S3, EFS
  Databases :           - Can be relational like RDS, or nonRelational like DianmoDB
  Network & Content Delivery :
  Security, Identity & Compliance


--------------------------------
  Region & Availability Zones
--------------------------------

    An Availability Zone is basically a Data Centre. A Data Centre is basically a building filled with servers.
      "An AZ is one or more discrete data Centres, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. "

    A Region is a geographical area. Each Region consists of 2 (or more) Availability Zones.

    --------------
    EdgeLocations
    --------------

    You will always have more EdgeLocations than you will regions.

    Edge locations are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content. Typically this consists of cloudFront, Amazon's Content
    Delivery Network (CND)

---------------------------
      IAM - Identity Access management
---------------------------

    IAM allows us to manage users and their level of access to the AWS Console.
    Important to understand IAM and how it works.

    Offers the following features:
      - Centralised Control of your AWS account
      - Shared Access to your AWS account
      - Granular Permissions
      - Identity Federation (including Active Directory, Facebook, Linkedin etc)
      - Multifactor Authentication
      - Provide Temporary access for users/devices and services where necessary
      - Allows password rotation policy
      - Integrates with different AWS services.

    Key Terms:

      - Users    :   End Users such as people, employees of an organisation
      - Groups   :   A collection of Users. Each user in the group will inherit the Permissions of the Group
      - Policies :   Policies are made up of documents, called Policy documents. These documents are in a format called JSON - give Permissions as to what a user/Group/Role is able to do.
      - Roles    :   You create roles and then assign them to AWS Resources.


    IAM is universal. Does not apply to regions at this time.
    The 'root account' is simply the account created when first setup your AWS account. Has complete admin access.

    New users have No permissions when first created.
    New Users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Keys when first created
