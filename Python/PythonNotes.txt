################## List Indexing and Slicing ###########################

List - an ordered sequence of Objects : [0,1,2,3,4,'A','B','C']

We can use the Slice Notation for any sequential data types like lists, strings, tuples, bytes, bytearrays and ranges. 

Indexing allows you to access/change/delete only a single cell of a list.

~~~~~INDEXING~~~~~~~~
 

 colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'white', 'black']

    print(color[0])  => 'red'


~~~~ Negative Indexing~~~~~~~

 colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'white', 'black']


    print(color[-1]) => 'black'
    print(color[-3]) => 'yellow'


~~~~ Assignment ~~~~~

    possible to change cell content usingg an assignment operation 

    basket = ['bread', 'butter','milk']
    basket[0] = 'cake'

    print(basket) = ['cake', 'butter','milk']


    **Assignment and deletion operations are not applicable to immutable sequential types.


~~~~ Deletion ~~~~~~~
    can delete any element from the list by using del statement

    basket = ['bread', 'butter','milk']
    del basket[0]

    print(basket) => ['butter','milk']


    **Assignment and deletion operations are not applicable to immutable sequential types.


~~~~ SLICE NOTATION ~~~~~~~

    Slice allows us to updates a bunch of cells at once. 

     nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
     
     sliced_nums = nums[2:7]
     print(sliced_nums) => [30, 40, 50, 60, 70]


            slice syntax is : start:stop:step 
                start = refers to the index of the elements which is used as start of our slice. 
                stop = referes to the index of the element we should stop just before to finish slice. 
                step = allows you to take each nth element whithin a start:stop range. 
    
    Slice Deletion 

        nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
        del nums[3:7]
        print(nums) => [10,20,30,80,90]






############# SPLIT and JOIN ###############

We can use the function split() to split a string and join() to join a string.

~~~~~~~~ SPLIT ~~~~~~~~~~

    string = 'Geek for Geeks'
    string_split = string.split(' ')
        string_split == ['Geek','for','Geeks']

    the .split creates a new list and separates with each space (' ')

    string = 'Greek*for*Geeks'
    string_split = string.split('*')
        string_split == ['Geek','for','Geeks']



~~~~~~~~ JOIN ~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    string = ['Geek','for','Geeks'] 
    string_join = '-'.join(string)
        string_join = Geek-for-Geek
    


########### Booleans #############

 A Boolean value is either true or false. 
    Booleans values can be manipulated and combined with Boolean operators. 

    Boolean Operators: 
        - or        Returns True if one of the statements is true
        - and       Returns True if both statements are true
        - not       Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true
        - == 
        - != 


    A = true , B = false , C = false 

    A or B = true
    A and B = false 
    not A = false 
    not B = true

    A or (C and B) = true
    (A and B) or C = false

    


########### Input and Output ############

    Two functions to handle input from a user and system. 

    1. input(prompt)   accepts input from a user
    2. print()         display output on the console 

    input() function converts it into a string. if user enters an iteger value, it will convert it into a string. 
    have to perform a typ conversion on the input value.




############ Loops  #############

    Python has 2 type of loops: for and while. 

~~ for ~~~~~~

    the for loop iterates over a given sequence. 

        numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
        
        for number in numbers:
            print(number) 

        // print 1 2 3 4 5 on a new line. 

    
~~ for and range ~~~~~

    for loops can iterate over a sequence of numbers using the range and xrange functions. The difference between range and xrange
    is that the range function returns a new list with numbers of that specifed range, where as xrange returns an iterator (more efficient)

        for x in range(5)
            print(x)

            //print 0 to 5
        
        for x in range(3,6)
            print(x)

            //prints 3,4,5

        a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            print(i, a[i])

    
~~ while ~~~~~

    while loop repeats as long as a certain Boolean condiiton is met. 

    count = 0

    while count < 5:
        print(count)
        count += 1

~~ break and continue~~

    break is used to exit a for loop or a while loop, whereas continue is used to 
    skip the current block, and return to the 'for' or 'while' statement. 

    count = 0
    while True: 
        print (count)
        count += 1
        if count >= 5:
            break
    
    for x in range(10):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            continue
        print(x)

~~ else clause ~~~

    We can use else for loops. When the loop condition of "for" or "while" statement fails then code part in "else" is executed. 
    If break statement is executed inside for loop then the "else" part is skipped. 

    count = 0
    while(count<5):
        print(count)
        count += 1
    else:
        print('count valued reached')




########### Control Flows  ##############

~~ If Statements ~~


    x = int(input(" Please enter an integer: ))
        if < 0:
            x = 0
            print('negative changed to 0')
        elif x >= 0: 
            print ('Zero and higher')
        else:
            print('yh')

~~ Switch Statements ~~ 

    There are 2 ways to write Switch cases in Python: 

    string week(int i) { 
        siwtch(i) { 
            case 0: 
                return "Sunday"
                break;
            case 1:
                return "Monday"
                break;
            case 2:
                return "Tuesday"
                break;
            case 3:
                return "Wednesday"
                break;
            case 4: 
                return "Thursday" 
                break;
            case 5: 
                return "Friday"
                break;
            case 6: 
                return "Saturday"
                break;
            default
                return "Invalid day"
        }
    }

    def week(i):
        switcher={
            0:'Sunday',
            1:'Monday',
            2:'Tuesday',
            3:'Wednesday',
            4:'Thursday',
            5:'Friday',
            6:'Saturday'
        }
        return switcher.get(i, "Invalid day of week)

~~ break and continue ~~
    the break statement, breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop. 

~~ pass Statements ~~

~~ Functions ~~

~~ Lambda Expressions ~~



############ File Handling #############


    File handling in Python requires no importing of modules. 

    File object provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default. 
        functions include: read, append or write to a file. 

~~~ Open ~~~

    Open(file,mode) 

    The open function takes two arguments, the name of the file and the mode for which we would like to open the file. 
    r = reading. w = writing . a = appending.

        filename = "hello.txt"
        file = open(filename, 'r')
        for line in file:
            print line

~~ Read ~~

    Read(), readLine() and readLines()

    read()  : return one big string 

    readline : return one line at a time 

    readlines : returns a list of lines

~~ Write ~~ 

    the method writes a sequences of strings to the file. 

    write ()   = used to wrtie a fixed sequence of character to a file. 

    writelines()  = writelines can write a list of strings. 

~~ Close ~~ 
    When you’re done with a file, use close() to close it and free up any system
    resources taken up by the open file 




########### Exception Handling ##############

    There are two distinguishable kinds of errors :
         syntax errors and exceptions. 

~~ Syntax Errors ~~

    Also known as parsing error. 

        while True print('Hello world')
                        ^
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax

    The parser repeats the offending line and displays a little ‘arrow’ pointing at the earliest point in the line where the error was detected

~~ Exception ~~ 

    If a statement or expression is syntactially correct - may cause an error when an attempt is made to 
    execute it. Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal. 

~~ Handling Exceptions ~~ 

    while True: 
        try: 
            x = int(input('please enter a number  : '))
            break
        except ValueError: 
            print('Oops! that was no valid number. Try again)


    Steps: 
    1. the try clause (the statement(s) between the true and except keywords) is executed. 
    2. if there is no exceptions, the except clause is skipped. 
    3. if an exceptions occurs during execution of the try - the rest of the clause is skipped. 
        If the exception type matches the except then it moves into the except clause (). 
    4. If an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in the except clause, 
        it is passed on to outer try statements; if no handler is found, it is an unhandled
        exception and execution stops with a message as shown above.


    Try statement may have more than one except clause - specify handlers for different exceptions. 

~~ Raising Exceptions ~~ 

    The raise statement allows us to force a specifed exception to occur. Example:

        >>>raise NameError('HiThere)
        TraceBack (most recent call last):
            File "<stdin>", line 1,  in <module>
        NameError: HiThere




########### Functions definition  ##############

    a function definition defines a user-defined function object. 

    def area(radius): 
        area = 3.142*radius*radius
        printThis(area)


    def greet(name='gurneet',time='morning'):
        print(f'Good {time} {name}, hope you good')

    name = input('enter your name : ')
    time = input('enter time time of day: ')




########### Class definition ##############
    A class definition defines a class object.

    A class is basically a blueprint for creating instances. 


        class Employee:
            pass 

    pass  - means the class is empty and we don't want to do anything with it now. 




    Class objects support two kinds of operations: Attribute References and Instantiation.

 ~~ Attribute References ~~ 
    
    class MyClass: 
        i = 12345

        def f(self):
            return 'hello world

    MyClass.i and MyClass.f are valid Attribute References.

 ~~ Instantiation ~~

        class MyClass: 
            i = 12345

            def f(self):
                return 'hello world

    Class Instantiation uses function nontation. 

    x = MyClass()    - creates a new instance of the class and assigns this object to the loval variable x. 

~~ __init__ ~~   (constructor)
    The instantiation operation (“calling” a class object) creates an empty object. 
    Many classes like to create objects with instances customized to a specific initial state.

    class Employee:
        def __init__(self, first, last , pay): 
            self.fname = first                         // this is an instance variable.
            self.lname = last 
            self.pay = pay 

    emp1 = Employee('Gurneet', 'Singh', 50000)
           

~~ Class functions ~~ 

    class Employee:
    def __init__(self,first,last,pay):
        self.fname = first
        self.lname = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@company.com'

    def print_fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.fname, self.lname)


    emp1 = Employee('Gurneet', 'Singh', 50000)
    print(emp1.print_fullname())

~~ Class Variables ~~ 

    class Employee:

        num_of_emp = 0                      // class variables
        raise_amount = 1.04

        def __init__(self,first,last,pay):
            self.fname = first
            self.lname = last
            self.pay = pay
            self.email = first + '.' + last + '@company.com'

            Employee.num_of_emp += 1        // updating class variable everytime a new instance of employee is made

        def print_fullname(self):
            return '{} {}'.format(self.fname, self.lname)

        def apply_raise(self):
            self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amount)


        emp1 = Employee('Gurneet', 'Singh', 50000)
        emp2 = Employee('tom', 'Gareth', 20000)
        print(emp1.num_of_emp)

~~ classMethod vs staticMethod ~~ 

    regular methods in a class automatically take the instance as the first argument.

    classMethods are alternative constructors.
    
    class Employee:

        num_of_emp = 0
        raise_amount = 1.04

        def __init__(self,first,last,pay):
            self.fname = first
            self.lname = last
            self.pay = pay
            self.email = first + '.' + last + '@company.com'

            Employee.num_of_emp += 1

        def print_fullname(self):
            return '{} {}'.format(self.fname, self.lname)

        def apply_raise(self):
            self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amount)

        @classmethod 
        def set_raise_amount(cls, amount):
            cls.raise_amount = amount

        @classmethod
        def from_string(cls,emp_str):
            first, last, pay = emp_str.split('-')
            return cls(first,last,pay)


    new_emp1 = Employee.from_string('Gurneet-Singh-7000')
    print(new_emp1.lname)



    STATIC METHODS 

    regular methods automatically pass the instance(self) as the first argument
    classMethod automatically pass the class (cls) as the first argument. 

    Static Methods pass nothing automatically. 

    import datetime
    class Employee:

        num_of_emp = 0
        raise_amount = 1.04

        def __init__(self,first,last,pay):
            self.fname = first
            self.lname = last
            self.pay = pay
            self.email = first + '.' + last + '@company.com'

        @staticmethod
        def is_workDay(day):
            if (day.weekday() == 5) or day.weekday() == 6:
                return False
            return True

~~ Inheritance ~~ 
    
    Inheritance allows us to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class. 
    This is useful because we can create subclasses and get all the functionality 
    of our parent class and we can overwrite or add completey new functionality. 



    class Animal:
        has_eyes = True 

        def __init__(self,type,breed,color,legs):
            self.type = type
            self.breed = breed 
            self.color = color
            self.legs = legs

    class Dog(Animal):              // inherits all the Animal attributes
        pass


~~ Property Decorators, Getters, Setters and Deleters ~~
