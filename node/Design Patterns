    What are Design Patterns
###################################

     Reusable, reliable solutions to problems that we face everyday in software development
    - Cataloged solutions
    - Reusable in different situations. 
    - Well documented
    - Language for collaboration 
    - Improve architecture

            - Pattern Name 
            - The Problem 
            - The Solution 
            - Consequences

        Anti-Pattern
    --------------
        Code smells if theres bad patterns. 
        Avoid:
        - Prototype on an instance
        - Callback Hell
        - synchronous coding/executions.

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Creational Patterns 
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Singleton:
            Ensure a class has only once instance and provides a global proint of access to it.    
                USE:   module.exports = .... 
                and then import the class. 

        Prototype: 
            Specify the kinds of objects to create using prototypical instance and create new objects by 
            copying this Prototype.

        The Factory Pattern: 
            Define an interface for creating an object. But let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
            Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses. 

        The Builder Pattern: 
            Seperate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction 
            process can create different representations. 



    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Structrual Patterns 
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Adapter Pattern: 
            Convert the interface of a class into another clients exect. Adapter lets classes work together 
            that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. 

        Proxy Pattern: 
            Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.


        Composite Pattern: 
            Compose objects into tree structure to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat 
            individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.


        Decorator Pattern: 
            Attach additional responsibility to an object dynamically. Decorators provides a flexible alternative 
            to subclassing for exending functionality. 


    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Behavioural Patterns 
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Chain of responsibility:
            Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a change 
            to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain. 

        Command Pattern: 
            Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize with different requests, 
            queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. 

        Iterator Pattern:
            Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying
            representation. 

        Observer Pattern: 
            Define a one-to-many dependecy between objects so that when one object changes state, all it's dependents 
            are notified and updated automatically. 

        Strategy Pattern: 
            Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm 
            vary independelty from clients that use it.
